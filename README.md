# City Population Trends - Data Analysis & Visualization

This project analyzes urban population trends across major global cities from 1950 to 2035. Using data from the United Nations Urbanization Prospects (2018), the project explores growth patterns, visualizes trends, and identifies key insights into urban expansion.

## 📌 Features of the Project:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Handling missing values
  - Converting data types
  - Removing duplicates and outliers
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Identifying population trends
  - Comparing city-wise growth patterns
- **Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn**
  - Line plots to track population growth over time
  - Comparative analysis of selected global cities
- **Insights from Population Trends**
  - Predicting future urbanization patterns
  - Identifying rapidly growing cities

## 📂 Dataset:
The dataset is sourced from the **United Nations Urbanization Prospects (2018)** and provides population estimates for cities worldwide from **1950 to 2035**.

## 📊 Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Google Colab** (for execution and analysis)

## 📝 How to Use:
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and clean the dataset
   - Perform exploratory analysis
   - Visualize urban population trends
3. Modify the code to analyze additional cities or trends.

## 📈 Key Insights:
- Rapid urbanization in cities like **Mumbai and Bangalore**.
- Historical trends suggest continued growth in major metropolitan areas.
- Data-driven insights can help in urban planning and resource allocation.
